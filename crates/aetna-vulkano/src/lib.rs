//! aetna-vulkano — Vulkan backend for Aetna, peer to `aetna-wgpu`.
//!
//! v5.3 introduces this crate as the second GPU backend so the
//! `aetna-core` ↔ backend boundary gets exercised against a wholly
//! separate GPU API. The wgpu side stays unchanged.
//!
//! Shape (per V5_3.md): mirror `aetna-wgpu`'s `Runner` surface, with
//! GPU-typed parameters swapped for `vulkano`'s. WGSL stays the source
//! shader language; `naga` transpiles to SPIR-V at pipeline build time.
//!
//! Empty for v5.3 step 1 — the crate exists so the workspace builds.
//! Subsequent steps wire up the naga helper, the Vulkan device/pipelines,
//! and the paint-stream loop.
